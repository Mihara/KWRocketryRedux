See the changelog for specifics on the differences between this and the old
KWRocketryRedux mod

How to install:
Firstly, Insure any older version of KW has been removed. (GameData/KWRocketry)


----MAIN INSTALLATION----

KWRocketry comes with an optional patch, which is installed using the included
PatchManager mod  There is no need to worry about merging directories anymore

In the GameData directory, you will find the following directories:

	KWRocketry
	PatchManager

The PatchManager is optional, and is only needed if you want to install the
Graduated Power Response configurations

Copy these directories to the GameData directory in your KSP game.

And that's it.
